## Description
This website will allow curious voyeurs to view more information about me including my education and work history, skills I possess for coding and/or the day-to-day of working and living in this world, as well as viewing a multitude of projects and application I have built over the course of my coding journey!

Visitors to my site will arrive at the Home page with a short description of myself, but they may navigate to my Portfolio proper (with a view at some of my applications--with links to their repositories as well as their deployed sites if applicable), to my ```View CV``` page which will redirect visitors to a Google PDF of my CV, as well as a Contact page to submit a form for any questions or opportunities!

Moreover, don't forget to check out the **Footer** as it houses icon-links to my LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, and a ```MailTo``` option to email me directly!
